Goals of this Arc runtime project are:

* to fix bugs

* to make Arc more hackable

* avoid changing the Arc language.

The later two go together because when there's some change we'd like
to make to Arc, we can make Arc more hackable instead, and then we can
get the "different" Arc that we want as a library, instead of having
to actually change Arc.

To make Arc more hackable, the Arc compiler is reflected into Arc.
Thus (hypothetically):

    arc> (ac-literal? 123)
    t
    arc> (eval 123)
    123
    arc> +
    #<procedure:+>
    arc> (ac-literal? +)
    nil
    arc> (eval +)
    Error: "Bad object in expression #<procedure:+>"
    arc> (def (ac-literal? x) (in (type x) 'str 'number 'int 'char 'fn))
    *** redefining ac-literal?
    #<procedure: ac-literal?>
    arc> (ac-literal? +)
    t
    arc> (eval +)
    #<procedure:+>
